1. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following
   criteria:
 Marks                  Grade
 >90                        A
 >80 and <=90        в
 >=60 and <=80      с
 below 60                D
Ans- 
        percentage = float(input("Enter your percentage: "))
if percentage > 90:
    print("A")
elif percentage > 80 and percentage <= 90:
    print("B")
elif percentage >= 60 and percentage <= 80:
    print("C")
else:
    print("D")


2. Write a program to accept the cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the following criteria:
 Tax                                Cost Price(in Rs)
 15%                                   >100000
 10%                        >50000 and <= 100000
 5%                                   < = 50000
Ans- 
        cost_price = float(input("Enter the cost price of the bike: "))
if cost_price > 100000:
    tax = 0.15 * cost_price
    print("The road tax to be paid is: ", tax)
elif cost_price > 50000 and cost_price <= 100000:
    tax = 0.10 * cost_price
    print("The road tax to be paid is: ", tax)
else:
    tax = 0.05 * cost_price
    print("The road tax to be paid is: ", tax)


3. Accept any city from the user and display monuments of that city.
  City                                   Monument
  Delhi                                  Red Fort
  Agra                                  Taj Mahal
  Jaipur                               Jal Mahal
Ans- 
        city = input("Enter the city: ")
if city.lower() == "delhi":
    print("Red Fort")
elif city.lower() == "agra":
    print("Taj Mahal")
elif city.lower() == "jaipur":
    print("Jal Mahal")
else:
    print("Monument not found.")


4. Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10.
Ans-
        number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = 0
while number > 10:
    number = number / 3
    count += 1


print("The number can be divided by 3", count)




5. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example
Ans- In Python, the while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is met.
Example-         count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1


6. Use a nested while loop to print 3 different patterns.
Ans-
1. Right Triangle Pattern
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
i = 1
while i <= rows:
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print("*", end="")
        j += 1
    print("")
    i += 1


2. Inverted Right Triangle Pattern
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
i = rows
while i >= 1:
    j = i
    while j >= 1:
        print("*", end="")
        j -= 1
    print("")
    i -= 1


3. Triangle
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
i = 1
while i <= rows:
    j = 1
    while j <= (rows - i):
        print(" ", end="")
        j += 1
    k = 1
    while k <= (2 * i - 1):
        print("*", end="")
        k += 1
    print("")
    i += 1


7. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.
Ans-
i = 10
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i -= 1


8. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1
Ans- 
i = 10
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
