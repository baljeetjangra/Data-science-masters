    "Ans - A database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. A database management system (DBMS) is software that helps users and applications interact with databases by providing tools for data storage, organization, retrieval, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of databases that differ in their data models, querying language, and storage mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on a relational data model and use SQL as the primary language for querying and managing data. SQL databases store data in tables with predefined columns and data types, and relationships between tables are defined through foreign keys. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use various data models such as key-value, document, column-family, or graph to store and retrieve data. NoSQL databases typically use a non-SQL query language and can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data with high velocity. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model based on tables with predefined columns and relationships between them, while NoSQL databases use various data models such as key-value, document, column-family, or graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query language: SQL databases use SQL as the primary language for querying and managing data, while NoSQL databases use non-SQL query languages specific to the data model used."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL that is used to define the database schema and its structure. The four main DDL commands are CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE, and they are used for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new table or a new database in SQL. For example, consider the following command that creates a new table named \"employees\" with three columns - \"id\", \"name\", and \"salary\":\n",

    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing table in SQL. For example, consider the following command that adds a new column \"age\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD age INT;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all the data from a table in SQL. For example, consider the following command that removes all the data from the \"employees\" table:\n",

    "A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. A primary key is used to ensure that each row in the table is unique and can be identified uniquely. In most cases, a primary key is a single column, such as an ID number, but it can also be a combination of columns.\n",

    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables. In other words, a foreign key is a way to link two tables together based on a common field.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two tables: students and courses. The students table has a primary key column named student_id, while the courses table has a primary key column named course_id. To establish a relationship between the two tables, the courses table can include a foreign key column named student_id that references the student_id column in the students table. This foreign key ensures that each course in the courses table is associated with a specific student in the students table."
